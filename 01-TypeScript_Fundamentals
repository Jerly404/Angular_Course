TypeScript Fundamentals:
  1. Basic Types
    What problem do they solve?
      In JavaScript, you can make mistakes without realizing it.
      TypeScript forces you to be explicit.

      Primitive types:
        let name: string = 'jerly';
        let age: number = 21;
        let active: boolean = true;

        If you try:
          age = "twenty-two"; -> //error
        TypeScript protects you.
      
      Typed arrays:
        let numbers: number[] = [1,2,3];
        let names: string[] = ["jerly", "404"];

      The any type (use it sparingly)
        let data: any = 10;
        data = "text";
        data = true:
      In Angular, avoid any.

      Union Types
        let id: number | string;
        id = 10;
        id = "ABC";
      Very common in Angular.

      Type alias:
        type ID = number | string;
        let userId: ID = 5;

  2. Interfaces
    What is an Interfaces?
      It is a contract that defines how an object should look.

      Basic interfaces:
        interface User {
          id: number;
          name: string;
          email: string;
        }
        Usage:
          const user: User = {
              id: 1,
              name: "Jerly404",
              email: "jerly@gmail.com",
          };

      Optional properties:
        interface Profile {
          bio?: string;
          age?: number;
        }

      Interfaces with functions:
        interface Logger {
          log(message: string): void;
        }

      Interfaces in Angular
      They are used for:
        - API responses
        - Data models
        - component inputs

  3. Classes
     Why classes?
     Angular is based on classes.

     Simple class:
      class Person {
        name: string;
        age: number;

        constructor(name: string, age: number) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }

        introduce(): string {
          return 'Hello, I am ${this.name}';
        }
      }

    Access modifiers:
      class Account {
        public owner: string;
        private balance: number;
        protected bank: string;

        constructor(owner: string, balance: number){
          this.owner = owner;
          this.balance = balance;
          this.bank = "MyBank";
        }
      }

    Short constructor systax:
      class Product {
        constructor(
          public id: number,
          public name: string,
          private price: number
        ){}
      }
      Very commonly used in Angular.
