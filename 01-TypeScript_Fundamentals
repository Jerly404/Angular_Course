TypeScript Fundamentals:
  1. Basic Types
    What problem do they solve?
      In JavaScript, you can make mistakes without realizing it.
      TypeScript forces you to be explicit.

      Primitive types:
        let name: string = 'jerly';
        let age: number = 21;
        let active: boolean = true;

        If you try:
          age = "twenty-two"; -> //error
        TypeScript protects you.
      
      Typed arrays:
        let numbers: number[] = [1,2,3];
        let names: string[] = ["jerly", "404"];

      The any type (use it sparingly)
        let data: any = 10;
        data = "text";
        data = true:
      In Angular, avoid any.

      Union Types
        let id: number | string;
        id = 10;
        id = "ABC";
      Very common in Angular.

      Type alias:
        type ID = number | string;
        let userId: ID = 5;
